**Octopath Traveler** is an award-winning RPG developed by **Square Enix**
and **Nintendo** for a compelling entry into the turn-based strategy category
:ref:`Gameplay`
of the *Nintendo Switch's* catalog. Read on to decide whether this story-driven RPG
is right for you.

Story
------
The storytelling in **Octopath Traveler** is what drives this game to compete, and
possibly perform better, than similar turn-based RPG strategy games. During the
duration of the game you will meet and add to your party eight different
characters, each with their own in-depth story to play through. The best part,
you can explore their stories at your own pace. More interested in Therion's
story than Primrose's? No problem! You will be able to focus on whichever
character's story is most interesting to you, while still being able to use
all of the characters you meet in and out of battle.

The characters of this game are:

==========  =========
Character   Class
==========  =========
Ophilia     Cleric
Cyrus       Scholar
Tressa      Merchant
Olberic     Warrior
Primrose    Dancer
Alfyn       Apothecary
Therion     Thief
H'aanit     Hunter
==========  =========

Each character has unique abilities that will aid you in your quest inside and
outside of battle. The option to multi-class is also presented later in the
game, so each of your characters will be able to do more than when the game
started.

.. _Gameplay:

Gameplay
---------
As stated before, the battle system in this game is a typical turn-based RPG
style. You will be able to use up to four of the eight characters per battle.
Both you and your enemy will be able to act once with each of your characters
per turn. These actions include attacks, spells, and other character-based
abilities. One unique element of **Octopath Traveler's** battle system is the
*boost ability*. Characters are given one boost point for each round of combat. These
points can be saved and used before a character acts. The number of boost points
that are applied to an action increases the power of whatever that action is.
