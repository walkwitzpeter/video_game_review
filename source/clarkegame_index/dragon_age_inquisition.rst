Dragon Age: Inquisition
=======================
One of the most surprising titles I have played in recent memory, Dragon Age:
Inquisition is one of the most interesting and unique RPGs of the last decade.

The first aspect of the game is the beautiful world. While not a completely
open-world experience, the segments of the map that are have been made
wonderfully to compliment the atmosphere and mood of the game.

Another of the great parts of the game is the **NPCs** or non-playable characters.
They fall into three categories of classes:


===========  ==========  ==========
Mage         Rogue       Warrior
===========  ==========  ==========
Range        Damage      Health
Elemental    Mobility    AOE
Healing      Critical    Defense
===========  ==========  ==========

This table shows some strengths of each class.

.. note::
   While you may choose a class for your own character, this game allows you to
   control any of your 4 party members at any time. This means if you are
   underwhelmed with your selection, it's no the end of the world.

Aside from that the story is very good. It revolves around an evil villain called
the Elder One. He kills the queen and opens a portal for his army of demons to
invade. The main character, who the players plays as, is marked by this strange
portal. They then embark on a quest to master the power of the mark, seal the portals,
and defeat the Elder One. Along the way you meet some very memorable characters
and make choices that impact the rest of your play through.

Perhaps the best aspect of this game is the replay ability. Each choice matters
and there is a vast amount of areas to explore and side missions to do. The game
also rewards exploration and smart, tactical play over hack and slash typical of
other RPGs.Lastly,there are DLCs that add lots of play time and add a lot
to the atmosphere and character of the game.

All in all, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a great game that the developers really
took time to craft a masterpiece. I love this game and I give it a 9.1/10. I
can't wait for the next entry into the series!
