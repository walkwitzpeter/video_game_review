The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim
===========================
Perhaps no game in recent memory has defined a genre as much as Bethesda's
2011 RPG title, Skyrim. It has been praised by critics and fans alike, with a
fandom that only seems to grow with time. However, there is much more to this
game than a simple hack and slash RPG.

One of the best aspects of Skyrim is the lore. This game is rich in story and
nuance, and it seems that you find something new every playthrough. From
numerous daedric gods, to small mysterious easter eggs in the open world,
Skyrim is an adventurer's dream.

Another of the great aspects is the map itself. The playable area includes
the entire country of Skyrim, and its island to the north, Solstheim, included
in the DLC *Dragonborn*. This map encompasses several distinct areas, all
with their own unique NPCs, seasons, landscapes, and enemies. This means that
there is a vast area for players to explore, along with many quests and
other activities that help immerse you in the vast world of Skyrim.

The sheer amount of side activities and great quests often helps to cover up
one of the weaker points of the game, namely the main story. The plot of the
game revolves around the player, a legendary warrior known as the dragonborn.
An evil dragon called Alduin, the world-eater has come to destroy the world
and reset the age. The game takes place in the 3rd Era, meaning it would be
the third time this happens. However, with their dragon power, the dragonborn
can harness his shout, or thuum, to defeat Alduin.

This sounds like a great plot, but much of it doesn't make sense lore-wise.
Along with that many players believe it to just be, well, boring. Skyrim is
a game that has many diverse quests, but the main story ones are nothing
special. Lastly, to complete the main story without mods, you are forced to
kill one of the game's most beloved characters. This leaves the end of the
questline unfulfilled for most players.

All in all, Skyrim is undoubtedly one of the greatest RPGs of all time, and
definitely a game worth checking out if you haven't already. As a player who
has played multiple playthroughs and spent dozens of hours in the game, I
give The Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim an 8.5 out of 10.
