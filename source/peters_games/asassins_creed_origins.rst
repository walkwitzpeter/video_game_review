Basic Storyline
---------------
We will be trying to write this review without any **big** spoilers, however we
feel the need to point out that there may be a few *small* ones here and there
so if you are planning on playing this game and would like to discover the story
for yourself you may want to skip to the :ref:`Gameplay` section of this review.

This game is set in ancient Egypt where you play as a Medjay named Bayek from
Siwa. The pharaoh at the beginning of the story is Ptolemy XIII, him and other
powerful men in masks end up killing your son and so a year later the gampleay
starts. You are driven by revenge against those in masks who caused your son's
death. Meanwhile Cleopatra takes the throne of Egypt and continues a very
corrupt regime that causes the common people to suffer. While seeking revenge
you continue to help out the common people.
